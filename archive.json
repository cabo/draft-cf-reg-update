The term \"subregistry\" should be reserved for registries that are nested within specific registrations. For example, at https://www.iana.org/assignments/isis-tlv-codepoints, \"IS-IS Sub-TLVs for Reverse Metric TLV\" is a subregistry for value 16 (\"Reverse Metric\") in the \"IS-IS Top-Level TLV Codepoints\" registry.\r\n> \r\n> Registry group\r\n> A set of registries presented as a single document through a common URL (i.e. https://iana.org/assignments/*) is called a \"registry group.\" A group consists of one or more registries. Registries are typically grouped when they are thematically related, such as when implementers are likely to use the different identifier types for a common protocol.\r\n> \r\n> In the past, these groups have been called \"top-level registries\" or \"registries\" (which we have now settled on as the descriptor for a discrete set of registrations, as above). [RFC 8126](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc8126) uses the term \"registry grouping,\" but the RFC Editor recommended the more flexible \"group.\"",
