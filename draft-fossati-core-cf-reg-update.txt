1.  Introduction

   Section 12.3 of [RFC7252] describes the registration procedures for
   the "CoAP Content-Formats" sub-registry within the "CoRE Parameters"
   registry [IANA.core-parameters].  (Note that the columns of this
   registry have been revised according to [Err4954].)  In particular,
   the text defines the rules for obtaining CoAP Content-Format
   identifiers from the First Come First Served (FCFS) portion of the
   sub-registry (10000-64999).  These rules do not involve the
   Designated Expert (DE) and are managed solely by IANA personnel to
   finalize the registration.  Unfortunately, the instructions do not
   explicitly require checking that the combination of content-type
   (i.e., media type with optional parameters) and content coding
   associated with the requested CoAP Content-Format is semantically
   valid.  This task is generally non-trivial, requiring knowledge from
   multiple documents and technologies, which is unfair to demand solely
   from the registrar.  This lack of guidance may engender confusion in
   both the registering party and the registrar, and could eventually
   lead to erroneous registrations.

   Section 5 of this memo updates the registration procedures for the
   "CoAP Content-Formats" sub-registry regarding its FCFS portion to
   reduce the risk of accidental or malicious errors.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms "media type", "content coding",
   "content-type" and "content format" as defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC9193].

3.  (Bad) Examples

   This section contains a few examples of registration requests for a
   CoAP Content-Format with identifier in the FCFS space (64999) that
   should not be allowed to succeed.

3.1.  The Media Type is Unknown

   The registrant requests an FCFS C-F ID for an unknown media type:

   +==========================+================+=======+
   | Content Type             | Content Coding | ID    |
   +==========================+================+=======+
   | application/unknown+cbor | -              | 64999 |
   +--------------------------+----------------+-------+

         Table 1: Attempt at Registering C-F for an
                     Unknown Media Type

3.2.  The Media Type Parameter is Unknown

   The registrant requests an FCFS C-F ID for an existing media type
   with an unknown parameter:

   +=======================================+================+=======+
   | Content Type                          | Content Coding | ID    |
   +=======================================+================+=======+
   | application/cose; unknown-parameter=1 | -              | 64999 |
   +---------------------------------------+----------------+-------+

        Table 2: Attempt at Registering C-F for Media Type with
                           Unknown Parameter

3.3.  The Media Type Parameter Value is Invalid

   The registrant requests an FCFS C-F ID for an existing media type
   with an invalid parameter value:

   +=====================================+================+=======+
   | Content Type                        | Content Coding | ID    |
   +=====================================+================+=======+
   | application/cose; cose-type=invalid | -              | 64999 |
   +-------------------------------------+----------------+-------+

       Table 3: Attempt at Registering C-F for Media Type with
                       Invalid Parameter Value

3.4.  The Content Coding is Unknown

   The registrant requests an FCFS C-F ID for an existing media type
   with an unknown content coding, "inflate":

   +========================+================+=======+
   | Content Type           | Content Coding | ID    |
   +========================+================+=======+
   | application/senml+cbor | inflate        | 64999 |
   +------------------------+----------------+-------+

         Table 4: Attempt at Registering C-F with
                  Unknown Content Coding

4.  Security Considerations

   This memo hardens the registration procedures of CoAP Content-Formats
   in ways that reduce the chances of malicious manipulation of the
   associated registry.

   Other than that, it does not change the Security Considerations of
   [RFC7252].

5.  IANA Considerations

   Before assigning a new Content-Format in the FCFS space, the
   registrar MUST check that:

   1.  The content-type associated with the requested Content-Format is
       not associated with an already registered CoAP Content-Format;

   2.  The media type associated with the requested Content-Format
       exists in the "Media Types" registry [IANA.media-types], or its
       registration has been approved;

   3.  The optional parameter names exist in association with the media
       type, and any parameter values associated with such parameter
       names are as expected;

   4.  If a Content Coding is specified, it exists in the "HTTP Content
       Coding Registry" of the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
       Parameters" [IANA.http-parameters].

   The registrar MAY forward the registration of a CoAP Content-Format
   in the FCFS portion of the registry (i.e., one for a CoAP Content-
   Format identifier in range 10000-64999) to one or more DEs of the
   registry for consultation.

   The registrar MUST forward the registration to one or more DEs of the
   registry when such registration involves any media type parameters.

   If the request is forwarded to the DE, their judgement is binding.
