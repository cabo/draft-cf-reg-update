1.  Introduction

   Section 12.3 of [RFC7252] describes the registration procedures for
   the CoRE CoAP Content-Format registry.

   In particular, it defines the rules for obtaining CoAP Content-
   Formats from the First Come First Served (FCFS) portion of registry
   (10000-64999).

   Said rules do not require the Designated Expert (DE) to be in the
   loop, and rely entirely on IANA personnel to complete the
   registration.

   Unfortunately, the instructions do not explicitly require checking
   that the combination of media type, optional parameters and content
   coding associated with the requested CoAP Content-Format is
   semantically valid.

   This is, in general, a non-trivial task, involving knowledge across
   multiple documents and technologies, which is unfair to demand from
   the registrar.

   This lack of guidance may engender confusion in both the registering
   party and the registrar, and could eventually lead to erroneous
   registrations.

   To improve the situation, Section 5 updates the registration
   procedures for the CoRE CoAP Content-Format registry defined in
   Section 12.3 of [RFC7252] regarding the FCFS of the registry.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  (Bad) Examples

   This section contains a few examples of registration requests for a
   CoAP Content-Format in the FCFS space (64999) that should not be
   allowed to succeed.

3.1.  Unknown Media Type

   The registrant requests an FCFS C-F for an unknown media type:

   +================+==========================+================+
   | Content Format | Media Type               | Content Coding |
   +================+==========================+================+
   | 64999          | application/unknown+cbor | -              |
   +----------------+--------------------------+----------------+

   Table 1: Attempt at Registering C-F for an Unknown Media Type

3.2.  Unknown Media Type Parameter

   The registrant requests an FCFS C-F for an existing media type with
   an unknown parameter:

   +================+=====================+================+
   | Content Format | Media Type          | Content Coding |
   +================+=====================+================+
   | 64999          | application/cose;   | -              |
   |                | unknown-parameter=1 |                |
   +----------------+---------------------+----------------+

       Table 2: Attempt at Registering C-F for Media Type
                     with Unknown Parameter

3.3.  Invalid Media Type Parameter Value

   The registrant requests an FCFS C-F for an existing media type with
   an invalid parameter value:

   +================+===================+================+
   | Content Format | Media Type        | Content Coding |
   +================+===================+================+
   | 64999          | application/cose; | -              |
   |                | cose-type=invalid |                |
   +----------------+-------------------+----------------+

      Table 3: Attempt at Registering C-F for Media Type
                 with Invalid Parameter Value

3.4.  Unknown Content Coding

   The registrant requests an FCFS C-F for an existing media type with
   an unknown content coding:

   +================+========================+================+
   | Content Format | Media Type             | Content Coding |
   +================+========================+================+
   | 64999          | application/senml+cbor | inflate        |
   +----------------+------------------------+----------------+

4.  Security Considerations

   This memo hardens the registration procedures of CoAP Content-Formats
   in ways that reduce the chances of malicious manipulation of the
   associated registry.

   Other than that, it does not change the Security Considerations of
   [RFC7252].

5.  IANA Considerations

   Before assigning a new Content-Format in the FCFS space, the
   registrar MUST check that:

   1.  The media type associated to the requested Content-Format is not
       associated to an already registered CoAP Content-Format;

   2.  The media type associated to the requested Content-Format exists
       in the IANA Media Type registry [IANA.media-types], or its
       registration has been approved;

   3.  The optional parameter names exist in association with the media
       type;

   4.  Any parameter values associated with such parameter names are as
       expected;

   5.  If Content Coding is required, it exist in the HTTP Content
       Coding Registry of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
       Parameters TODO-ref.

   The registrar MAY forward the registration of a CoAP Content-Format
   in the FCFS portion of the registry (i.e., one for a CoAP Content-
   Format in range 10000-64999) to one or more DEs of the registry for
   consultation.

   IANA MUST forward the registration to one or more DEs of the registry
   when such registration involves any media type parameters.

   If the request is forwarded to the DE, their judgement is binding.
