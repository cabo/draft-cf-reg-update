1.  Introduction

   Section 12.3 of [RFC7252] describes the registration procedures for
   the "CoAP Content-Formats" registry within the "CoRE Parameters"
   registry group [IANA.core-parameters].  (Note that the columns of
   this registry have been revised according to [Err4954].)  In
   particular, the text defines the rules for obtaining CoAP Content-
   Format identifiers from the First Come First Served (FCFS) portion of
   the registry (10000-64999).  These rules do not involve the
   Designated Expert (DE) and are managed solely by IANA personnel to
   finalize the registration.  Unfortunately, the instructions do not
   explicitly require checking that the combination of content-type
   (i.e., media type with optional parameters) and content coding
   associated with the requested CoAP Content-Format is semantically
   valid.  This task is generally non-trivial, requiring knowledge from
   multiple documents and technologies, which is unfair to demand solely
   from the registrar.  This lack of guidance may engender confusion in
   both the registering party and the registrar, and could eventually
   lead to erroneous registrations.

   Section 5 of this memo updates the registration procedures for the
   "CoAP Content-Formats" registry regarding its FCFS portion to reduce
   the risk of accidental or malicious errors.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms "media type", "content coding",
   "content-type" and "content format" as defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC9193].

3.  (Bad) Examples

   This section contains a few examples of registration requests for a
   CoAP Content-Format with identifier in the FCFS space (64999) that
   should not be allowed to succeed.

3.1.  The Media Type is Unknown

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for an unknown
   media type:

   +==========================+================+=======+
   | Content Type             | Content Coding | ID    |
   +==========================+================+=======+
   | application/unknown+cbor | -              | 64999 |
   +--------------------------+----------------+-------+

       Table 1: Attempt at Registering Content-Format
                 for an Unknown Media Type

3.2.  The Media Type Parameter is Unknown

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for an existing
   media type with an unknown parameter:

   +=======================================+================+=======+
   | Content Type                          | Content Coding | ID    |
   +=======================================+================+=======+
   | application/cose; unknown-parameter=1 | -              | 64999 |
   +---------------------------------------+----------------+-------+

     Table 2: Attempt at Registering Content-Format for Media Type
                         with Unknown Parameter

3.3.  The Media Type Parameter Value is Invalid

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for an existing
   media type with an invalid parameter value:

   +=====================================+================+=======+
   | Content Type                        | Content Coding | ID    |
   +=====================================+================+=======+
   | application/cose; cose-type=invalid | -              | 64999 |
   +-------------------------------------+----------------+-------+

       Table 3: Attempt at Registering Content-Format for Media
                  Type with Invalid Parameter Value

3.4.  The Content Coding is Unknown

   The registrant requests an FCFS Content-Format ID for an existing
   media type with an unknown content coding, "inflate":

   +========================+================+=======+
   | Content Type           | Content Coding | ID    |
   +========================+================+=======+
   | application/senml+cbor | inflate        | 64999 |
   +------------------------+----------------+-------+

      Table 4: Attempt at Registering Content-Format
               with Unknown Content Coding

4.  Security Considerations

   This memo hardens the registration procedures of CoAP Content-Formats
   in ways that reduce the chances of malicious manipulation of the
   associated registry.

   Other than that, it does not change the Security Considerations of
   [RFC7252].

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Expert Review with Expert Check "FCFS+"

   This document introduces the term "Expert Review (Expert Check:
   FCFS+)" to describe a registration policy that would typically have
   been handled as FCFS, except the approval checklist is complex enough
   to require advice from a DE.  Such policy can be viewed as a
   "lightweight" form of the "full" Expert Review.

   A protocol that requires "Expert Check: FCFS+" for registration of
   its parameters MUST specify what the FCFS+ checks entail.

5.2.  CoAP Content-Formats Registration Procedures Update

   The CoAP Content-Formats registration procedures defined in
   Section 12.3 of [RFC7252] are modified to transition the 10000-64999
   range from FCFS to "Expert Review (Expert Check: FCFS+)", with the
   FCFS+ checklist described in Section 5.2.1.

          +=============+=======================================+
          | Range       | Registration Procedures               |
          +=============+=======================================+
          | 0-255       | Expert Review (Full)                  |
          +-------------+---------------------------------------+
          | 256-9999    | IETF Review or IESG Approval          |
          +-------------+---------------------------------------+
          | 10000-64999 | Expert Review (Expert Check: FCFS+)   |
          +-------------+---------------------------------------+
          | 65000-65535 | Experimental use (no operational use) |
          +-------------+---------------------------------------+

             Table 5: Updated CoAP Content-Formats Registration
                                 Procedures

   The registration procedure for the 0-255 range has been slightly
   modified -- from "Expert Review" to "Expert Review (Full)" -- to
   clearly distinguish it from the policy that applies to the
   10000-64999 range.  For the 0-255 range, the DE must also evaluate
   the requested codepoint concerning the limited availability of the
   1-byte codepoint space.  For the 10000-64999 range, this criterion
   does not apply.

5.2.1.  FCFS+ Checks

   The "Expert Check: FCFS+" checklist for the CoAP Content-Formats
   registry consist of the following steps:

   1.  The combination of content-type and content coding for which the
       registration is requested must not be already present in the
       "CoAP Content-Formats" registry;

   2.  The media type associated with the requested Content-Format must
       exist in the "Media Types" registry [IANA.media-types], or IANA
       has approved its registration;

   3.  The optional parameter names must exist in association with the
       media type, and any parameter values associated with such
       parameter names are as expected;

   4.  If a Content Coding is specified, it must exist in the "HTTP
       Content Coding Registry" of the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol
       (HTTP) Parameters" [IANA.http-parameters], or IANA has approved
       its registration.
